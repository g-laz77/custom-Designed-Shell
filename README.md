# custom-Designed-Shell


This shell has been created by me using system calls. It can handle background and foreground processes. It should also be able to handle 
input/output redirections and pipes. Also supports signal such as CTRL+C, CTRL+V.
And functions such as:-
1. killall:-kills all processes
2. jobs:-lists all processes
3. kjob:-kills job with pid
